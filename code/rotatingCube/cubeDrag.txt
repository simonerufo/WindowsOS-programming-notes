To achieve a draggable and spinning cube in C with OpenGL (Win32 API)

1-  Draw a cube using OpenGL.

2-  Handle mouse events using the Win32 API:

    2.1-    Track mouse drag movement. 
                                        (BOOL DragDetect(
                                           [in] HWND  hwnd,
                                           [in] POINT pt
                                         );)

    2.2-    Detect release to start spinning.

3- Apply rotation in real-time based on the drag delta.
